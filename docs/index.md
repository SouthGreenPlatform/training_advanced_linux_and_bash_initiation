This course offers to develop and enhance advanced Linux shell command line and scripting skills for the processing and analysis of NGS data. We will work on a HPC server and use linux powerful commands to allow to analyze big amount of biological data.

## Program

* Connecting to a distant HPC
* Manipuling large text files
* Complex searching for text in a file
* Using regular expression
* Combining several commands
* Writing simple shell scripts

## Learning objectives

After this course, participants should be able to:  
* Work with larger data sets
* Run existing data analysis tools using the command line
* Using powerful text manipulation tool (sed, ask)
* Chain and combine commands to manipulate complex data
* Perform the same actions on many files
* Write simple bash script

## Application

This is an {{config.extra.institute}} course. The course is open for PhD students, postdocs,
group leaders and core facility staff related to the {{config.extra.institute}} Platform (IRD,
CIRAD, INRAE and the Alliance Bioversity international-CIAT).

If we receive more applications than we can accommodate, participants will be selected based on several
criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to
attend the course. We also take in consideration a balance between the different
institute and department.

Please note that {{config.extra.institute}} training events do not provide any formal university
credits. The training content is estimated to correspond to a certain number of
credits, however the estimated credits are just guidelines. If formal credits
are crucial, the student needs to confer with the home department before
submitting a course application in order to establish whether the course is
valid for formal credits or not.
